Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Kafka Plugin installs `Apache Kafka <http://kafka.apache.org/>`_ and
`Apache ZooKeeper <https://zookeeper.apache.org/>`_ in a
Mirantis OpenStack environment deployed by Fuel. Apache Kafka is a
publish-subscribe messaging system. It is fast, scalable, and durable.

The Kafka Plugin is created for exchanging messages between various
components of StackLight and Ceilometer, but it is generic enough to
accommodate other usages.
